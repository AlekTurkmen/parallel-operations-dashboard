1. Project Requirements
Your final project must include:
* A working system that demonstrates your original project idea (adjusted for any reasonable changes).

* A populated database with realistic sample data.

* A database schema that reflects strong design principles:

   * Appropriate use of primary keys, foreign keys, constraints.

   * Sensible normalization (unless intentionally denormalized for scaling reasons).

      * SQL CREATE TABLE statements that match your database design.
      * (ORM objects are fine too)

         * Code hosted and accessible on GitHub.

         * Attention to scaling:

            * Index designs and database structures that would support future growth.

            * Thoughtful explanation of how your system could handle larger data volumes.

Technical expectations:
               * The most technically difficult or interesting part of your project should be clearly identified.

               * You should be able to explain your major technical decisions and trade-offs.

2. Presentation Requirements
During your demo (maximum 10 minutes total):
                  * Briefly introduce your project:

                     * What it is, what it does, who uses it.

                        * Walk through the key functionality.

                        * Show how data was populated.

                        * Show the core functionality of the project
                        * Provide a way for everyone in the class to use your project (via hosting on starlink network or other simple install flow)

                        * Be ready to discuss:

                           * Any challenges you faced.

                           * The technical highlight of your system (e.g., complex query, indexing strategy, interesting schema design).

                           * How your system would scale in a real-world setting.

Notes:
                              * Setup time (plugging in laptops, connecting to projector, etc.) is counted toward your 10 minutes — be prepared.

                              * 2 Minute Q&A at the end.

3. Final Write-up (Proposal) Requirements
Submit a single final write-up per group. It should include:

                                                * Approximate number of entries per table.
